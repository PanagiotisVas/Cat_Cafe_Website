## Overview
This project was developed as a final assignment for the Web Development course. The goal was to build a **complete, modern, and responsive** website from scratch, demonstrating proficiency in frontend technologies and UI/UX design.

The website represents a cozy space where customers can enjoy coffee while interacting with adoptable cats. It features a clean aesthetic, intuitive navigation, and works seamlessly across all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Key Features
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Built with a "Mobile-First" approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid. Adapts to any screen size.
* **🎨 Modern UI:** Clean typography, consistent color palette, and smooth hover effects.
* **🐱 Interactive Elements:**
    * **Cat Gallery:** A showcase of the "staff" (the cats) with hover animations.
    * **Menu Section:** A structured layout displaying food and drink options.
    * **Contact Form:** A styled HTML form for reservations or inquiries.
* **Semantically Correct:** Uses proper HTML5 semantic tags (header, nav, section, footer) for accessibility and SEO.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5** - Structure and semantics.
* **CSS3** - Styling, Flexbox, Grid, and Animations.
